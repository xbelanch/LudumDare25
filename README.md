I ckeck it out the urban dictionary to find some inspiration. The [first defintion](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=villain) talks of villain as a *A true Villain considers nothing taboo and will penetrate the heart and mind of all mankind in an effort to enlighten or destroy.*. These words helps me to start to thinks some plot for a simple pixelated game.





Slender

You're the Slender after killed a explorer guy. The first screen room you're standing close to the explorer died body. A still open "linterna" is on the ground. You move to the right and put back  the nine notes. After all the slender move his head to the "camera" and kills the game.
