My first LD48 competition: Ludum Dare 25

[Don't Look At Me - Xavier - 48 Hour Compo Entry](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=15692)


Personal remake of Terry Cavanagh's "Don't look back" but changing a bit its history. 

Sorry for the inconveniences but there's no ending though I'm very intrigued about the concept of a game without endings or goals. Anyway, I'll take the needed time to improve the game and plot as well (and try to imagine an ending)



Random thoughts
---------------

I ckeck it out the urban dictionary to find some inspiration. The [first defintion](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=villain) talks of villain as a *A true Villain considers nothing taboo and will penetrate the heart and mind of all mankind in an effort to enlighten or destroy.*. These words helps me to start to thinks some plot for a simple pixelated game.





Slender
-------

You're the Slender after killed a explorer guy. The first screen room you're standing close to the explorer died body. A still open "linterna" is on the ground. You move to the right and put back  the nine notes. After all the slender move his head to the "camera" and kills the game. 


Graphic notes
-------------

Using Pixelmator and Pixen and GIMP. Pixelmator is a good graphics tool but lacks of features like shortcuts or scale an image without rescaling (important if you're doing pixel art). Pixen is great for sprites animations and GIMP... oh well, GIMP is great, but under OSX still has a low performance.
